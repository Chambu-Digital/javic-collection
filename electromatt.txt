Audit my backend and fix MongoDB connection handling so that:

Only one global MongoDB connection is created

Connection pooling is correctly configured

No routes, controllers, cron jobs, or background workers create new DB connections

All scripts and jobs gracefully close connections

The solution is production-safe and scalable

Requirements:

Identify and remove any connect() calls inside request handlers

Move DB initialization to app startup

Configure optimal pool settings (maxPoolSize, minPoolSize, timeouts)

Show before vs after code

Add defensive logging to detect future leaks

Ensure the fix supports high traffic (10k+ concurrent users) without increasing Atlas tier
